	Title: BattleShips

#Overview of the gameplay:
	This game is designed for 2 players. The game is played using 3 grids which are identical with the size of 10x10.
	Each player will have their own grid where they will arrange their ships. The game can only commence after the ship
	arrangements are done. Each player can only see their arrangements but not their opponent's.
	
	Each player will have one of the following ships:
	- Submarine (1square)
	- Frigate (2 squares)
	- Destroyer (3 squares)
	- Cruiser (4 squares)
	- Battleship (5 squares)
	- Carrier (8 squares)
	
	The ships can be positioned anywhere on the grid, either horizontally or vertically as long as they do not intercept each other.
	The game is turn based, therefore, when commence, the first player will have to target a coordinate on the grid to attack.
	If there is a ship on that coordinate, a "hit" is issued, otherwise, it is a "miss".
	A player wins when all ships are destroyed but hitting all the correct coordinates containing the ships (a total of 23 squares).
